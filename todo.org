* Theory
** generate_line should take beats and end_word, returns a matching line (end word rhymes, same meter)
** we need to find words that come before the end_word using markov chains, but reading backward?
** just go the correct number of words, rather than beats?

* Tasks
** TODO Chainer should chain backwards using generate_line
** TODO Rhymer should give us some words that rhyme
** TODO Chainer should generate one line at a time
** TODO Chainer should return a line that is the proper number of words long

* App Loop
** User is presented with rhyming and non-rhyming words. At least option will rhyme with the previous end word.
** User selects a word
** A line is returned, ending wit a word that rhymes the first word
